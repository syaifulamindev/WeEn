# Introduction and Goals

Welcome to **WeEn**, an open-source initiative aimed at creating a comprehensive learning material and note-taking application. With **WeEn**, we aim to provide a versatile and user-friendly solution, built on the solid foundation of the arc42 architectural documentation framework.

Our primary goal is to foster a vibrant and collaborative learning environment where the community can actively participate, share knowledge, and contribute to the development of this project. By making the architectural documentation central to our approach, we ensure that every aspect of the application is well-defined, making it easier for both developers and users to understand the design and decision-making process.

**Open-Source Goals:**
1. **Create Comprehensive Architectural Documentation**: Our first step is to develop a detailed architectural documentation using the arc42 methodology. This documentation will serve as the cornerstone of the project, offering a clear roadmap and guidelines for development. It will help us determine the best solutions to implement while allowing for agile evolution as the project matures.

2. **Define Quality Attributes**: We prioritize quality attributes to ensure that our application meets high standards. As the project grows, we will continually assess and adapt these attributes to accommodate changing requirements and maintain a high level of performance, security, and usability.

3. **End-to-End Development**: We are committed to delivering a full-fledged note-taking application from inception to the final product. We will start with requirements gathering, proceed to design and implementation, and finally, deliver a polished, user-friendly application.

4. **Versatility and Evolution**: Although we begin as a note-taking app, our project is designed to evolve into various kinds of educational and productivity tools. Our open-source nature enables us to adapt and expand our offering as the community's needs change and grow.

5. **Community-Centric Learning**: **WeEn** is not just about software development; it's about learning together as a community. We encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and active participation from developers and users alike. By working together, we can create a more effective and impactful tool.

6. **Open Source Portfolio Building**: As a contributor or user of **WeEn**, you have the opportunity to enhance your open-source portfolio and gain practical experience in software development. Whether you're an experienced developer or just starting your journey, there's a place for you here.

Join us in this exciting journey of learning and development. Together, we can make a difference in the world of education and knowledge management.
